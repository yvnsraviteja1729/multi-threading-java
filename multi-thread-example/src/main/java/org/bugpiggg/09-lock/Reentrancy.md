Reentrancy is a key concept in concurrent programming that allows a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times without causing a deadlock. In Java, this is primarily facilitated by the `ReentrantLock` class. When a thread holds a reentrant lock, it can enter a synchronized block (or method) protected by that lock again without blocking itself.

### How Reentrancy Works

When a thread acquires a reentrant lock, it maintains a counter that tracks how many times the lock has been acquired by that thread. Each time the thread enters the synchronized block, the counter is incremented. The lock is released only when the counter is decremented back to zero. This mechanism allows the same thread to re-enter the lock without being blocked.

### Example of Reentrancy

Let's illustrate this with a simple example:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class SharedResource {
    private int value = 0;
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    // Method that increments value
    public void increment() {
        lock.lock(); // Acquire the lock
        try {
            value++;
            // Calling another method that also requires the same lock
            nestedIncrement();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock(); // Always unlock in a finally block
        }
    }

    // Nested method that also requires the lock
    private void nestedIncrement() {
        lock.lock(); // This will not block because the thread already holds the lock
        try {
            value++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public int getValue() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            return value;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}

public class ReentrancyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();
        
        // Incrementing value in a single thread
        resource.increment();
        
        // Retrieving the value
        System.out.println("Final Value: " + resource.getValue());
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **SharedResource Class**: 
   - This class contains a shared variable `value` and a `ReentrantLock`.

2. **increment Method**: 
   - This method acquires the lock and increments the `value`. It then calls the `nestedIncrement` method, which also tries to acquire the same lock.
   - Since the lock is reentrant, the same thread can acquire it again without blocking.

3. **nestedIncrement Method**: 
   - This method also tries to acquire the same lock. However, since the thread already holds the lock, it can proceed without getting blocked.
   - After incrementing the `value`, it releases the lock.

4. **getValue Method**: 
   - This method locks the resource, retrieves the value, and unlocks it.

### Benefits of Reentrancy

- **Avoids Deadlocks**: Since the same thread can re-enter a lock it already holds, it reduces the chances of deadlocks that can occur with non-reentrant locks.
- **Simplifies Code**: You can call methods that also require the same lock without worrying about the locking mechanism.

### Conclusion

Reentrancy is a powerful feature that allows threads to manage their own locking behavior more effectively. It provides greater flexibility in designing concurrent applications and can help prevent common issues like deadlocks, making it a valuable tool in a developer's toolkit.
