`ReentrantLock` and `ReentrantReadWriteLock` are both part of Java's concurrency framework, but they serve different purposes and have distinct features. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

### 1. Locking Mechanism

- **ReentrantLock**:
  - Provides a mutual exclusion lock (mutex).
  - Only one thread can hold the lock at a time, which is suitable for scenarios where access to a shared resource needs to be strictly controlled.

- **ReentrantReadWriteLock**:
  - Provides two types of locks: read locks and write locks.
  - Multiple threads can hold the read lock simultaneously, allowing concurrent read access as long as no thread holds the write lock.
  - Only one thread can hold the write lock at a time, and no other thread can read or write when a write lock is held.

### 2. Use Cases

- **ReentrantLock**:
  - Best suited for scenarios where threads need exclusive access to a resource, like modifying shared data structures.
  
- **ReentrantReadWriteLock**:
  - Ideal for situations where read operations are much more frequent than write operations, such as caching or databases. It allows for better concurrency in these cases.

### 3. Performance

- **ReentrantLock**:
  - Generally simpler but can lead to contention issues in high-read scenarios since only one thread can access the resource at a time.

- **ReentrantReadWriteLock**:
  - Can improve performance by allowing multiple threads to read simultaneously. However, it may incur overhead due to the complexity of managing read and write locks.

### 4. Reentrancy

- Both locks are reentrant, meaning that if a thread holds a lock, it can reacquire it without blocking itself. This is useful for avoiding deadlocks in recursive methods.

### 5. Fairness

- Both `ReentrantLock` and `ReentrantReadWriteLock` can be configured to be fair or unfair.
  - **Fair Locking**: Threads are granted access in the order they requested it.
  - **Unfair Locking**: Threads may be granted access out of order, potentially leading to higher throughput but less predictability.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple comparison in code:

**Using `ReentrantLock`:**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class LockExample {
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private int counter = 0;

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            counter++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

**Using `ReentrantReadWriteLock`:**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

public class ReadWriteLockExample {
    private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private int counter = 0;

    public int readCounter() {
        rwLock.readLock().lock();
        try {
            return counter;
        } finally {
            rwLock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }

    public void incrementCounter() {
        rwLock.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            counter++;
        } finally {
            rwLock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **ReentrantLock** is suitable for simple mutual exclusion.
- **ReentrantReadWriteLock** allows for improved performance with concurrent reads and exclusive writes, making it advantageous in read-heavy situations.
